I am good at communicating and thoroughly enjoy designing. I feel these qualities are shown well in a team by being able to describe what design I envision clearly and easily accommodate change and input put forth by teammates.
I am very much a visual learner which can prove difficult for tasks within programing that are difficult to understand conceptually and I can get frustrated easily and thus waste time on tasks I know I need help on. I hope to improve my understanding and level of software engineering through the help of team collaboration and guidance from the TA’s during this project.
My goal is to become significantly more proficient in Java and a better understanding of how object oriented programing works and the potential it offers to programers building software. This goal is important to me as I would like to develop my own software in the future. 
I won't succeed this goal by the end of this course as its a goal of understanding that I hope to develop throughout my career as a software engineer, however I believe this project will give me a great starting platform! I am actively working on this goal by programming daily and watching a lot of tutorials within different object oriented programing languages and looking into there individual benefits and differences. I can improve on furthering this goal by spending more time programing with a team which is brilliant as this project is allowing me to start doing so.
Options I have to achieve my goal are to stay consistently in contact with my team to be sure we are all working towards the same goal with independent tasks and having staff support to aid where necessary. I hope to ask the staff less and use team collaboration more to overcome barriers. The only thing stopping me from not reaching this goal is not having enough time to keep improving.
I am going to do everything in my power to succeed and achieve this goal. I am going to do this consistently and make sure I have daily improvement. The first step is to make a game plan and prepare to execute it. Being part of a strong team that communicates difficulties and strengths will certainly help me achieve this goal. I can make an action plan to achieve this goal ut have to keep in mind small steps progressional to allow me to achieve my final goal ultimately.

My strong points are are out of the box thinking and i like communicating
out of the box thinking helps because it can bring new and innovative ideas 
to the team. Communication is an essential  quality to be able to work in a team.
I can lose focus  when we are not progressing. Being stable withoout any progres can
be really bad for me.My learning goal for this course is to :
	become a better programmer ,
	learn how to work with a team,
	being better at communicating,
	learn how an application should be developed
This is important to me because it will take me one step further to obtaining my bsa ,
and also one step further to becoming a better programmer.I will achieve my goal when
i get a functioning working application.We are currently working on our goal 24/7 because w
we are fully commited to this project.Everything is going well.Nothing needs improvement because 
everything is working perfectly. Working hard and as team  are my options to achieve my goal. 
I want to explore all of my option and depending on which one is better i can  follow one.
Nothing can stop me . Im fully dedicated to this project.To reach my goal im going to work with my team
in a smart and innovative way. We will go step by step through every obstacle and overcome it.
We are going to do this each and every day we have a meeting.The first concrete step that i can take 
right now is righting this essay and making a plan with my fellow students.My teammates will help me because
different people dont think the same. everybody has his own ideas and his own way of doing things.
We will definitely have an action plan that will divide the work based on everyones strengths and weaknesses.

I have good leadership and organisation. I have captained all rugby teams I have been a part of, which
displays this. These are important traits that a team must have. I struggle with time management but am
actively trying to improve. I also struggle to hold focus.
My goal with this project is to better my teamwork within a programming environment along with
improving my programming skills. I am excited to work in a group environment to create an application. If
we are able to create an application that is both aesthetically pleasing and functional, I will have met my
goal.
We have already made a good connection as both a team and as mates so I expect our teamwork to be
great. I definitely need to touch up on certain areas of my programming abilities such as threads, which I
avoided in the last OOP exam.
We have many different options we can take in order to become better programmers. I personally think
we should focus on splitting up jobs into smaller doable tasks. This will requires planning and organising.
There are small things that could stop me from achieving my goal but nothing noteworthy.
I am going to work hard and stay on top of tasks. We will have completed the goal when the project is
also complete. We will begin by thinking up ideas for the design and getting used to the applications we
will be using. My teammates should help answer questions or find solutions to certain aspects we can't
solve. We are starting to create an action plan now.

I’m almost always available for questioning, i will reply quickly to any questions teammates might have for me.
I don't get angry quickly in groups, generally easy going.
I’m heavily dependant on planning, i don’t work well without a plan. I’m also not very flexible, if a plan is made but changed last minute it is difficult for me to adapt.
My learning goal is improving at working as a team, important because it is likely that our future jobs will involve programming as a team, also important for other areas in life. Will have succeeded if we can deliver a product at the end of the quarter we are all happy with and if any issues that come up during that process can be resolved.
We are actively trying to communicate well from the beginning and thus far i feel like it has been going very well, personally i could speak up more in the group.
We need to keep communicating well and make good agreements about who does what, when, where and how. It is important that we do all of this to achieve our goals.
I will do my best to achieve this goal by continuing to take our options into consideration continually throughout the project. The first concrete step we can take right now is be actively using our WhatsApp group to communicate, i will do my best to do this. Nothing can prevent achieving this goal.

#Personal Development Plan

##Step 1: Develop a goal

* What are two of your strong points?
    - I try to communicate a lot
    - I try to listen to what everone has to say and take that in account
* Do you have examples of this?
    - No
* How is this point shown in a team?
    - Discussing a lot, trying to come with agreements and from that create something that satasfies everyone's wishes.
* What are two of your weaker points?
    - I tend to lose focus
    - I tend to waste time when I get stuck on something, instead of asking help.
* Do you have examples of this?
    - No
* How is this point shown in a team?
    - It's pretty critical when someone gets stuck on something and doesn't ask for help. It damages the whole team.
* Can you make a core quadrant of this?
    - No

##Step 2: Create plan to achieve your goal

*G - Goal*

I hope this course will teach me how to work better in a team and get better at looking up information. It's important to be have those skills, because later in a professional enviroment I should also be able to do that. I think I'll achieve this goals if our projects succeeds.

*R - Reality (Your current situation)*

I'm currently working on my goal by communicating with my team members. Everything is going well currently, I don't think any improvement's can be made. 

*O - Options (Look at possible options)*

I'll use every oppertunity work on my goal. There's currently nothing stopping me from achieving my goal. 

*W - Will (Motivation, plan of action)*

I'll do everything in my power to achieve my goal, from this point and onwards. Activily discussing any misunderstandings and ideas. My peers can help me by joining me in my discussion. I unfortunately don't have a plan for this goal.

(student number: 4839684)

I am hard-working and perseverant, but I do not have much experience in programming and I haven't worked in this big teams before.
My learning goal for this course is to improve my teamwork, programming in java and maybe leadership skills
as they are going to be very useful when I start working in the IT industry. I am sure I will improve these skills
during this course but there will always be room for improvement.
I am currently starting to work on this project. I have the option to work with 6 other students and as long as we work together on this project we will be able to finish it successfully.
We see eye to eye at the moment and I think we are going to successfully finish this project, even though sometimes communication might be hard in a 7 people group.
We are currently making a plan of how the software will look like, when to meet, etc and in some days we are planning to put the plan into practice and start coding.
We are going to have a weekly plan with specific task that we are going to accomplish.
I am a very motivated person, willing to do whatever it takes to get the highest grade possible and learn as much as I can from this experience. I am willing to spend a lot of time doing it, communicate with my partners and help each other during this process.
Nothing can stop me achieve this goal. I am fully dedicated to this project as it is something new to me and there's a lot to learn from it.
