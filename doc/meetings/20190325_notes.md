## **MEETING notes OOPP 25/03/2019**

General
* tag? (release notes)
* great readme?
* get started on report maybe?

Decisions on friend system:
* use own database
* global leaderboard?
* adding friends instead of being able to see everybody
* seperate table for friends, adding connections

Statistics:
* gitlab-esque graphs for total and individual footprints/polar score
* achievements give badges, make user allowed to pick what badge to display on home screen
