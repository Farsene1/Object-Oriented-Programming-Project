We emit a LOT of CO2
In one year the world emits 33 billion tons of CO2. That many tons could form a giant “CO2 cube” measuring over 28 km on each side. By 2030, our emissions of CO2 could rise to 40 billion tons…



It’s not only about CO2
There are many other, and stronger, greenhouse gases than CO2. By 2030, all these emissions could grow by 34 percent - or what would correspond to a total of 57 billion tons of CO2.





Where does it come from?
Besides the burning of fossil fuels for energy and transportation, deforestation is a major source of CO2 emissions. Why? Because the CO2 that trees absorb and store is released into the atmosphere…




Deforestation is a major factor
…deforestation is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than all the world’s cars, trucks, planes and ships combined.


Less Driving – park your car once a day if possible and work from home or just walk to your destination. Carpooling is a great way to help reduce carbon emissions while also providing you with networking opportunities.



Water Usage – the efforts to maintain and purify our drinking water can take a huge toll on carbon emissions. Consider the treatment plants and their operating equipment footprints along with all of the various chemicals needed to purify our water. Use water wisely and do not waste it.
